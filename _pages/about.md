Greatings! I’m Shiyuan(Sean) Zhang, currently a CS major master’s student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research interest lies in data-centric machine learning, trustworthy NLP, and vision langauge models. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor’s degree also at the UIUC. In life, I have the perfect companionship of this white rag called <a href="../images/lulu.jpg">Lulu</a>.
